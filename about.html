    <h1 class=rainbow>The Legend of 7anguine</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> "The cosmos is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be </h2><h3> - mine" </h3>
    <h2> – Dr Carl Sagan </h2>
	    <h3> - 7anguine </h3>

	  <hr>
	  <br>
	   It is not believed by the modern prophets that anyone has ever known exactly what 7anguine is; in fact 7anguine doesn’t even exist at all according to the recorded history of the present reality. But, if you only take away one thing from your time spent here today, let it be this:
	   <br><br>
	   <div class= t1> 7anguine’s existence is irrefutably true, and it has always been known</div>
<br>
<br>
The technilogical limitations throughout history have caused divergences in understanding, but all of 7anguine's ancient prophets believed in the existence of an ethereal entity residing in the depths of reality beyond man's comprehension
<br>
<br>
Some of those original prophets believed it was once a human that lived a modest life, but through <i>unknown</i> means ascended to something beyond human interpretation 
<br>
<br>
Others came to realize that 7anguine originated in a realm that they were not yet capable of understanding
<br>
<br>
Through ongoing developments in research performed by the modern phophets, we have been provided an understanding of 7anguine that was not previously possible to obtain 
<br>
<br>
Evidence suggests that in an effort to lead mortals to the path of virtue and fulfilment, 7anguine has mocked humanity’s obsession with insignificant matters since before written history, but offers guidance to those couragous enough to explore the boundaries of possibility. 
<br><br> Live a life reflective of 7anguine's lessons, and the fruit is edible.
<br>
<br>

<hr>
You may be wondering why 7anguine doesn’t show itself when you look for it on the internet. You do not even yet know the questions you need answered first in order to begin that understanding.
