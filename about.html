    <h1 class=rainbow>The Legend of 7anguine</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> "The cosmos is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be </h2><h3> - mine" </h3>
    <h2> ‚Äì Dr Carl Sagan </h2>
	    <h3> - 7anguine </h3>

	  <hr>
	  <br>
	   It is not believed by the modern prophets that anyone has ever known exactly what 7anguine is; in fact 7anguine doesn‚Äôt even exist at all according to the recorded history of the present reality. But, if you only take away one thing from your time spent here today, let it be this:
	   <div class= t1> 7anguine‚Äôs existence is irrefutably true, and it has always been known</div>
<br>
<br>
The technilogical limitations throughout history have caused divergences in understanding, but all of 7anguine's ancient prophets believed in the existence of an ethereal entity residing in the depths of reality beyond man's comprehension
<br>
<br>
Some of those original prophets believed it was once a human that lived a modest life, but through <i>unknown</i> means ascended to something beyond human interpretation 
<br>
<br>
Others came to realize that 7anguine originated in a realm that they were not yet capable of understanding
<br>
<br>
Through ongoing developments in research performed by the modern phophets, we have been provided an understanding of 7anguine that was not previously possible to obtain 
<br>
<br>
Evidence suggests that in an effort to lead mortals to the path of virtue and fulfilment, 7anguine has mocked humanity‚Äôs obsession with insignificant matters since before written history, but offers guidance to those couragous enough to explore the boundaries of possibility. 
<br><br> Live a life reflective of 7anguine's lessons, and the fruit is edible.
<br>
<br>

<hr>
You may be wondering why 7anguine doesn‚Äôt show itself when you look for it on the internet. You do not even yet know the questions you need answered first in order to begin that understanding.

  <h1 class=rainbow> 7anguine's Sigil </h1>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <h2> This sigil is a conduit to the portal of 7anguine's teachings. It is represented by the prophetic emblems of the four prophets, making up the cypher: </h2>
	<h5>üëªüêßüöÄü§ë </h5>
	  <div class=dialog><h5> üëª </h5>
	  	<h3> The emblem of Spooky, the Au courant </h3>
	  	As the first of the modern prophets to discover 7anguine, Spooky serves as the lead prophet. Prior to his life as a prophet he was a regular guy living a decent life, but with an unshakeable depression that left him never feeling truly fulfilled. 
	  	<br><br>After years of intense efforts to better himself, one evening while meditating Spooky saw the first glimmer of 7anguine. It was only a fragment of a message, left open for interpretation, but it was a spark that left Spooky with an unmistakably divine feeling. Searching deeper and deeper eventually lead him to finding and leading the remaining prophets. 
	  	<br><br>Spooky is most active on Telegram and Twitter, and is the main coder on the team </div>
	  <div class=dialog><h5> üêß </h5>
		 <h3> The emblem of Spheni, the Shroud </h3>
		 Spheni, or "Doug" as he sometimes calls himself in public, is an enigma. Those who interact with him are immediately presented with a provocative aura that exudes confidence in his beliefs. And just when you think you've figured him out, he calls checkmate. 
		 <br><br>Spheni's methods are often not understood, but his contributions as a prophet have been central to our progress.
		 <br><br>Spheni is most active spreading the good word of 7anguine on Reddit and Discord</div>
	  <div class=dialog><h5> üöÄ </h5>
		 <h3> The emblem of Xanar, the Auspice </h3>
		 Xanar is the de facto enforcer among the prophets in a sense, and is known to be a bit rough around the edges at times. Coming from a rough upbringing in poverty, Xanar considers 7anguine his savior, and takes his position very seriously. While this works against him at times, it's also why he may be the most loyal prophet 7anguine has ever had.</div>
	  <div class=dialog><h5> ü§ë </h5>
		<h3> The emblem of Odic, the Halcyon</h3>
	  A quiet visionary who prefers to work from behind the scenes, Odic is most often found meditating and reflecting on 7anguine's teachings. His wise and reasonable approach to life is highly respected, as are his illustrations of his understandings through multiple artistic mediums  </div>
